//Write a JS function that stores the name and age of two persons in objects and then filters them by minimum age.
//The input comes as array of string elements. The first element is the minimum age.
// The second and third elements are the name and age of the first person and the fourth and fifth elements –
// the name and age of the second person. The three age parameters need to be parsed as numbers.
//The output should be printed to the console.
