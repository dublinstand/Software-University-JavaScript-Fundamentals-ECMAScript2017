//Write a JS function that splits a passed in JS code into separate parts.
// The passed in code will always have one or more spaces between operators and operands.
// Normal brackets (‘(‘,’)’), commas (,), semicolons (;) and the member access operator (‘.’(dot), as in “console.log”)
// should also be used for splitting. String literals will always be initialized with double quotes (") and will contain only letters.
// Make sure there are no empty entries in the output.
//
//The input comes as array of one string element - the JS code that has to be split.
//The output should be printed on the console, with each elements obtained from the split is printed on a new line.
